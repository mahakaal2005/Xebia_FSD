Difference b/w var,let and const:-
    1->let and const have block scope while var has function scope(by defaut js files are functions only 
    so function scope means they are available across the whole js file but not cross files).

    2->let and var are mutable while const is immutable

    3->var allows hoisting while let and const does not , you need to declare before accessing;


In JS null is also an object data type;

There is no concept of default value in JS not even null;

console.log(5=='5');  //gives true because it only compares values
console.log(5==='5'); //gives false because it compares first data type and if same then values;

we use while loop when we want to do odd looping(i.e.,we do not know how many times we wanna iterate priorly) this is 
the basic Difference between while and for loop;

for loop does not have optimized control whereas while and do while has;

In case we were returning the value bt not storing it anywhere so it was getting stored in a stack and not getting destroyed;
